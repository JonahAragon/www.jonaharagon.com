# Third Party Public Keys

## What is this?

I created this page to act as a third party source for information like public keys, key fingerprints, or onion links to various organizations and websites. The information here should always match the information publicly available on these groups's respective websites. If you receive information about the projects below that differ from what is on this page, please [contact me](/accounts/) immediately.

## Why would I trust this page?

You probably shouldn't. I've created this page mostly for my own benefit, so I can find these fingerprints without having to trust the infrastructure of these various projects and people online. However, this page may prove valuable to others as a "second opinion" of sorts if you want additional reassurance that the keys from these groups are indeed correct.

I was inspired by FantasyCookie17 who has [a similar page to this on his website](https://fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com/services/verify.html). Check it out if you want a *third* opinion :)
