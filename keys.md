This page contains (or will contain) all the public keys I use to sign/encrypt things online. If I'm missing something you'd like to use, let me know and I'll add it.

If you wish to verify the keys on this page, you can browse the [Git commits on GitHub](https://github.com/JonahAragon/www.jonaharagon.com/commits/master){:.itl}, they're all signed as well.

## GPG

You can encrypt files or messages to me using this GPG public key. Please note I may not be able to reply in a timely fashion due to not always having access to my private key on all devices, and would prefer other communication methods such as Matrix for more urgent discussions when possible.

If you don't use GPG, you can still encrypt your message to me by visiting [this page on Keybase](https://keybase.io/encrypt#jonaharagon){:.itl}, typing in your message, clicking encrypt, and sending the encrypted text to me in an email.
