Certification policy
====================

I will sign someone's key at certification level 1 without having met him or
her in person, if I am reasonably certain that the key holder's identity
corresponds with the key. Usually, this involves:

1) Working with the key holder on online projects for extended periods,
   such as PrivacyTools.

I never sign someone's key at certification level 2 or 3 without having met
him or her in person. Usually, this involves:

1) Meeting in real life, exchanging key fingerprints
2) exchanging government-issued IDs, and checking the person's name
   against the names on the key

However, in case I already know the person with whom I'm exchanging
keys, step 2 may be skipped.

Certification level depends on how well I know the person. For example,
I may sign an acquaintance's key at certification level 2, and close friends
and family at certification level 3.
