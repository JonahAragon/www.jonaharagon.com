I believe in a web free of massive tracking networks and invasive corporations and governments. To that end, I've been working on developing free services and promoting privacy-centric software online through my work on projects such as [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/services/){:.itl} and [opennic.org](https://www.opennic.org/){:.itl}.

If you like what I do, you can support me financially through donations. These donations will go towards covering server and domain costs for the services and websites I provide, as well as encourage me to continue my work in the privacy space and help promote the decentralization and personal control of data online.
